Basics
======

Game engines are structured to provide a framework for creating and managing the various components of a game, such as rendering, physics, input, and scripting. The core idea is to streamline development by offering reusable systems and tools.

Start and Update Methods
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* ``Start Method``: Used for initialization logic. It runs once when an object is first created or activated in the game.
* ``Update Method``: Used for per-frame logic. It runs repeatedly, usually once per frame, and handles dynamic behaviors like movement or input processing.

Prefabs
^^^^^^^

Prefabs are preconfigured templates for game objects. They allow developers to create reusable objects with predefined properties, behaviors, and hierarchies, making it easier to replicate consistent objects throughout the game.
